# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Guide for Drivigo

## ✅ Build Issues Fixed

The Vercel build error has been resolved! Here are the issues that were identified and fixed:

### 1. **CSS Class Issues** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Invalid Tailwind CSS classes were being used
- `@apply border-border` - `border-border` is not a valid Tailwind class
- Custom color variants like `text-success-dark`, `bg-danger-light` were undefined

**Solution:** 
- Replaced `border-border` with `border-gray-200`
- Updated all alert classes to use standard Tailwind colors:
  - `text-success-dark` → `text-green-800`
  - `bg-success-light` → `bg-green-100`
  - Similar fixes for error, warning, and info variants

### 2. **Accessibility Warnings** ⚠️ → ✅
**Problem:** Empty `href="#"` attributes causing accessibility warnings
- Social media links with empty hrefs
- Terms/Privacy policy links with empty hrefs
- "Forgot password" links with empty hrefs

**Solution:** 
- Converted placeholder links to buttons where appropriate
- Added proper `type="button"` for form buttons
- Maintained styling while improving accessibility

### 3. **Unused Imports** ⚠️ → ✅
**Problem:** `useNavigate` was imported but not used in DashboardPage

**Solution:** Removed unused import

## 🔧 Vercel Deployment Setup

### Step 1: Environment Variables
Set these environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

```env
REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here
REACT_APP_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id_here
```

### Step 2: Build Settings
The `vercel.json` file is configured with:
- **Build Command:** `cd client && npm run build`
- **Output Directory:** `client/build`
- **Install Command:** `cd client && npm install`
- **Framework:** None (React app in subdirectory)

### Step 3: Routing Configuration
The vercel.json includes a rewrite rule to handle client-side routing:
```json
"rewrites": [
  {
    "source": "/(.*)",
    "destination": "/index.html"
  }
]
```

## 🏗️ Build Verification

✅ **Local build test passed:**
```bash
cd client
